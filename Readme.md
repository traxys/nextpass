A CLI to Nextcloud Passwords

The CLI will prompt you with the server you want to use if you do not provide a `LoginDetails` file. Check the `nextcloud-passwords-client` documentation if you want to supply your own.

Those details are safely encrypted with the `key` argument, or the `NEXTPASS_KEY` variable.
